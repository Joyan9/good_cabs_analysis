## Problem Statement
Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in the Indian market by focusing on tier-2 cities. 
To drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction by 2024, the Goodcabs management team aims to assess the company's performance across key metrics such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. 
The key problem is to quickly analyze Goodcabs' performance across the identified metrics and provide the insights directly to the Chief of Operations, as requested by the management team.
